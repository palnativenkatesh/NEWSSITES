# NewsScraper - Scrape any newspaper automatically

This is a simple python script for automatically scraping the most
recent articles from any news-site.

Just add the websites you want to scrape to `NewsPapers.json` and the
script will go through and scrape each site listed in the file.

This repository was originally created as part of [this tutorial](https://venkatehs.github.io/blog/Automatic-news-scraper/).

Thanks to [Pål Grønås Drange](https://github.com/pgdr) for his contributions to the repository.
